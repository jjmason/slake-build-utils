slake-build-utils
=================

These utilities allow you to write moar concise Slakefiles, by providing some
common build utilities as a reusable library.


### Example

```coffee
_  = require 'slake-build-utils'
fs = _.fs
glob  = require 'glob' .sync

defaults    = void
environment =
  package: require './package.json'

build = _.build \src (file, source) -->
  source |> _.compile defaults               \
         |> _.expand-macros environment      \
         |> fs.write (fs.as-js "lib/#file")  \
         |> _.minify defaults                \
         |> fs.write (fs.as-min "lib/#file") 


task \build 'Builds JavaScript files out of LiveScript ones.' ->
  fs.initialise \lib
  for file in glob '**/*.ls', cwd: 'src'
    build file
```


### Installation

Just grab it from NPM:

    $ npm install -d slake-build-utils
    

### Building

To compile everything from the source, you'll need [LiveScript][]. Once you've
installed that, just run the Slake `build` task, which should generate all the
JavaScript files in the `lib` directory:

    $ npm install -gd LiveScript
    $ git clone git://github.com/killdream/slake-build-utils.git
    $ cd slake-build-utils
    $ npm install -d
    $ slake build
